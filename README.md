# How to use GIT Tutorial :)


# What I promised to go through:

1. My code was working one week ago, but now it's broken, I don't know what I've changed (you can check the changes with git)

2. I lost my work (your work is on a server so you automatically have a backup)

3. I want to work on a programming project with four people and every time one of us changes something we need to e-mail the changes (you can work on the project at the same time and the changes are automatically tracked and git makes sure that any clashes between two people's works are handled)
